                Implementing new technology vendors can be challenging. We transitioned a service-based client changing
                from one
                vendor to another. Proper planning, progress reporting, vendor communication, and testing enabled the
                business
                to have critical transparency. Our team further optimized delivery by identifying newly available
                automation and
                supporting the teams with training.

                proper
